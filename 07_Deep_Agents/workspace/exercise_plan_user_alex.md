## Safety Tips & Important Notes

### General Safety:
- Always warm up before exercising
- Stop if you experience pain (not to be confused with muscle fatigue)
- Stay hydrated throughout workouts
- Listen to your body and take extra rest days if needed

### Form Priorities:
1. **Quality over quantity** - Better to do fewer reps with good form
2. **Controlled movements** - Avoid using momentum
3. **Full range of motion** - When flexibility allows
4. **Breathing** - Don't hold your breath during exercises

### Modification Guidelines:
- **Too Easy:** Add reps, sets, or time
- **Too Hard:** Reduce range of motion or use easier variations
- **Joint Issues:** Choose low-impact alternatives
- **Time Constraints:** Focus on compound movements

### Recovery Recommendations:
- Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly
- Stay hydrated (8-10 glasses of water daily)
- Consume protein within 2 hours post-workout
- Consider light walking on rest days
