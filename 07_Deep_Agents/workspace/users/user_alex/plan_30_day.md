# 💡 SUCCESS TIPS

1. **Start Small**: It's better to do 5 minutes consistently than 20 minutes sporadically
2. **Stack Habits**: Attach new habits to existing routines (e.g., breathwork while coffee brews)
3. **Plan for Obstacles**: Identify your likely challenges and prepare solutions
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge progress daily, no matter how small
5. **Stay Flexible**: Life happens - adapt rather than abandon
6. **Focus on How You Feel**: Energy, mood, and sleep quality matter more than perfect execution

## Red Flags to Watch For
- Extreme fatigue or persistent soreness (reduce intensity)
- Worsening sleep despite good practices (evaluate stress, diet, environment)
- All-or-nothing thinking (remember: progress, not perfection)
- Skipping rest days (recovery is essential for results)
